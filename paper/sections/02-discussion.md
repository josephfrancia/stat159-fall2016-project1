&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what's the big deal about reproducibility? To tackle this vague question, lets first answer another question: what does it mean for a paper's results to be reproducible? Reproducibility simply means that a third party (peer reviewer, fellow researcher, etc.) can reproduce a paper's results, using the computational methods described in the paper. As a result, it can mean a couple things if a paper's results fail to be reproducible.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For one, it could simply mean that a paper's results were not reproducible because of a simple coding/computational error (e.g. [Reinhart-Rogoff controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_in_a_Time_of_Debt)). In this case, checking for reproducibiility in one's paper would help because the authors would have discovered a coding error when figuring out why their results were not reproducible.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, it could also mean that the paper's results were actually correct, but just not reproducible. How does this happen? Maybe the author's computations and results were all totally correct, but the author's paper was ambiguous or unclear about how certain computations were made. As a result, making this kind of paper reproducible would result in a paper that is much more clear and forthcoming about its computational methodology.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that we have shown how a lack of reproducibility can be symptomatic of more serious flaws, lets talk about the software tools that help us keep our research reproducible. Lets first talk about Git.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's a quick definitional introduction to what Git is. Git is version-control software that allows us to keep track of changes that we have made in a file over time. It also allows a user to explore various versions of a file. Without Git, a user only has access to the most recently saved version of a file. With Git, however, a user can have access to previously committed versions of a file.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why might this be useful? Lets look at an example. For instance, lets say that a user decides that some code he or she deleted awhile back might actually turn out to be useful for the next phase of the project. Without Git, this user would have to rewrite all this code that had already been written. However, if this user had used Git, this user would have access to all previous versions of the project, thus allowing the user to simply copy-paste some of the old code that had been deleted.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another advantage to using Git has to do with reproducibility. Git essentially forces us to explicitly document the changes we’ve made to a file with relevant, detailed comments. Thus, if months after a project we decide that we want to try to reproduce the results of our project, we can look at the previous versions and the associated comments in order to make sense of what exactly it is that we did (The command “git log” allows us to take a look at all the previous versions of our file and all of the associated comments).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Git is useful for tracking changes in our personal projects or code, it is not sufficient for tracking changes in group projects. For that task, Github is a nice tool that accompanies Git.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s important to highlight the differences between GitHub and Git because from my experience, people often conflate the two. GitHub is essentially an extension of Git. While Git allows a single user to track changes on a file, GitHub is an online repository that allows multiple users to track each other’s changes on the same file.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Github is an online repository that allows its users to store their Git repositories online. By allowing people to share repositories, Github helps people collaborate on a project with greater ease. For instance, one can have multiple branches for a single project on Github, thus allowing project partners to work separately on certain branches while collaborating on others. Moreover, Github allows project partners to see what changes or contributions that their partners have made to files on certain branches.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this paper, I used both Git and Github.
