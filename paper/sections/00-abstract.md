&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although 
reproducibility in research may seem like a basic concept, even very intelligent, well-respected academics can fail to achieve reproducibility in their work. All it takes is a little carelessness and some bad luck to destroy the reputations of honest researchers. As a result, in this report, I am going to spend time talking about tools that can help prevent errors and mistakes that can compromise a project's reproducibility. 
Version control software ([Git](https://git-scm.com/)), remote repositories ([GitHub](http://github.com)), and **Makefiles** are some examples of these tools that help maintain a projct's reproducibility. I am also going to talk about computing tools that are useful for making project reports. Specifically, I'm going to focus on   **Markdown**, an intuitive formatting syntax that converts easily to **HTML**, and **Pandoc**, a document converter.
