&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My intention for this project is for it to to be useful even after the class has ended. I want to be able to refer back to this project in the future in case I run into problems using any of these computing tools.  As a result, I will be providing clear, intuitive explanations of the computing tools that we have learned thus far (Git, Make, Pandoc, etc.).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this is my first time using some of these tools, I also plan on discussing how I solved some of the issues I ran into when doing this project. Usually, I would reference the lab links that Professor Sanchez provided in order to solve through my issues. However, I would also occasionally use websites like [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or [Quora](https://quora.com/) in order to answer some of my questions. In short, I want this report to help me produce reproducible project results in the future.
